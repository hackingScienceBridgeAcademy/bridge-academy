# Longer RaspberryPi Projects

## Now that you have had a go at writing some programmes, you'll now create and build your own Pi projects! 

What you build is up to you, you don't have to stick to the guides completly. If you have more ideas with what you can do with the equipment we have, go ahead! 

(Also let us know if you would like to order anything else). 

### You will have 3 sessions to see how far you get with these projects. We are here to help you as much as we can during the sessions, you are free to work on the projects outside of the lessons indpendently and with each other. 

We want you to build on these projects futher at UCL and eventually showcase your work. 

### The main aims of the projects are to have fun, develop independent learning skills and see what you can create.

Though the simple programmes you have been writing have been teaching you the basics of programming itself, it is perhaps more intresting to see some more real world applications. Technology has become part of our lives:

The projects you will do will explore areas relating to gaming, sports/healthcare and machine learning. 

There are 3 projects, see their mini descriptions below and click on them to find the corresponding guides: 

If you find any more guides or useful resources, please let us know and we can add them to the pages.  

[Gamming System](./pi_gamming.md) 

[Sports Science](./pi_sports_science.md)

[Google Voice Kit](./pi_google_voice_kits.md) 

We hear a lot about machine learning, You can build a standalone voice recognition system with TensorFlow or Google SDK or add voice recognition and natural language processing to your Raspberry Pi-based projects
